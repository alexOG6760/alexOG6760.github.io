Julio Alejandro Nunez
This page tells who I am and the little person I love most in the world.
I have an image file
I have an index.html file 
I have a css.style file
First I opened the index.html file
filled in the frist elements opening and tags
Then I did the atributes and paragraphs.
Then the syles using the proper tags.
With color and style
